# Greetings Coders! 

I made this repository following the Next Level Week Journey from day 1 until now(currently on day 2).

## Technologies
This code is being made using Java as main language, but I'm also using Spring Boot, and some other dependencies, like 
- Spring Web,
- Flyway,
- Spring Boot DevTools,
- Lombok,
- JPA,
- H2 Database.

## How to run?
To run this code, if you are using Intellij IDEA, just clone this repository and run the PlannerApplication file, just as easy as it sounds right? ðŸ˜Š

## Special Thanks
I'm looking forward to finish this project as well as improve whenever I can.</br>
I'm really grateful for Rocketseat by helping me improve my abilities and teach me how to use all these technologies.
<br/>
<br/>
That's it, thank you for reading until now,</br>
Rodrigo Ide
